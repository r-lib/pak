Downloading installing (currently) 37 dependencies takes 1-1.5 minutes platforms binaries, 4 minutes platforms compile everything source (measured Linux). goal create self-contained binaries CRAN. main advantage data step can show progress /messages user. bundling fails, pak errors. avoid creating non-functional binary package. Hopefully CRAN just try creating binary , later. also works well platforms (yet) binaries, e.g. M1 macs, Linux new experimental Windows platform. running inside R CMD check, pak bundle dependencies, make checks faster. Unlike traditional R CMD check setup, CRAN install package check. Instead, pre-install , refer install log check. set env vars pre-install, pak still bundle dependencies case. pak installed GitHub, using remotes::install_github() similar, dependency bundling happens. nice platforms build self-contained binary. see also next item. DESCRIPTION Remotes field, pak bundle dependencies, emits message suggests using create_dev_lib(). can’t easily install GitHub using base R functions . running R CMD check, pak uses testthat.R bundle dependencies temporary installation used check. However, pak copies dependencies case, make check faster. copying dependencies fails, pak skips test suite. reason copying testthat.R instead install time way avoid check warning large /library directory. pak installation currently tested bundled dependencies, setup.R bundles , user’s cache directory. make sure can still use devtools::test() alike development. developing pak interactively, e.g. using load_all(), use create_dev_lib() copy dependencies user’s cache directory. summary, various bundling modes: install.packages() binary pkg CRAN → pak ready use install.packages() source pkg CRAN → install /library R CMD INSTALL CRAN (build binaries) → install /library R CMD INSTALL (CRAN) R CMD check → bundle R CMD check → copy /library, ignore errors remotes::install_github() without Remotes → install /library remotes::install_github() Remotes → bundle devtools::test() similar → copy user’s cache directory","code":""},{"path":"http://pak.r-lib.org/dev/authors.html","id":null,"dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Authors","title":"Authors and Citation","text":"Gábor Csárdi.

# Install specified required packages

Install the specified packages, or the ones required by the package or
project in the current working directory.

## Usage

``` r
pak(pkg = NULL, ...)
```

## Arguments

- pkg:

  Package names or remote package specifications to install. See [pak
  package
  sources](https://pak.r-lib.org/dev/reference/pak_package_sources.md)
  for details. If `NULL`, will install all development dependencies for
  the current package.

- ...:

  Extra arguments are passed to
  [`pkg_install()`](https://pak.r-lib.org/dev/reference/pkg_install.md)
  or
  [`local_install_dev_deps()`](https://pak.r-lib.org/dev/reference/local_install_dev_deps.md).

## Details

This is a convenience function:

- If you want to install some packages, it is easier to type than
  [`pkg_install()`](https://pak.r-lib.org/dev/reference/pkg_install.md).

- If you want to install all the packages that are needed for the
  development of a package or project, then it is easier to type than
  [`local_install_dev_deps()`](https://pak.r-lib.org/dev/reference/local_install_dev_deps.md).

- You don't need to remember two functions to install packages, just
  one.

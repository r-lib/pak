Package: pak
Version: 0.4.0
Title: Another Approach to Package Installation
Description: The goal of 'pak' is to make package installation faster and
    more reliable. In particular, it performs all HTTP operations in parallel,
    so metadata resolution and package downloads are fast. Metadata and package
    files are cached on the local disk as well. 'pak' has a dependency solver,
    so it finds version conflicts before performing the installation. This
    version of 'pak' supports CRAN, 'Bioconductor' and 'GitHub' packages as well.

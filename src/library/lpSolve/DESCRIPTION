Description: Lp_solve is freely available (under LGPL 2) software for
        solving linear, integer and mixed integer programs. In this
        implementation we supply a "wrapper" function in C and some R
        functions that solve general linear/integer problems,
        assignment problems, and transportation problems. This version
        calls lp_solve version 5.5.

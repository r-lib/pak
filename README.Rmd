## :rocket: Short tour

#### Install or update packages from CRAN or Bioconductor

```{asciicast cran}
pak::pkg_install("tibble")
```

#### Install packages from GitHub

```{asciicast gh}
pak::pkg_install("tidyverse/tibble")
```

#### Look up dependencies

```{asciicast deps}
pak::pkg_deps_tree("tibble")
```

#### Explain dependencies

```{asciicast explain}
pak::pkg_deps_explain("tibble", "rlang")
```

#### Install a local package and its dependencies

```{asciicast local-pre, include = FALSE}
dl <- pak::pkg_download("cli", platforms = "source", tempdir())
untar(dl$fulltarget[1])
```

```{asciicast local}
pak::local_install("cli")
```

### How do I ... ?

Start with our [our TLDR document](https://pak.r-lib.org/dev/reference/tldr.html) to solve specific issues.

### FAQ

Check out [list of frequently asked questions](https://pak.r-lib.org/dev/reference/faq.html).

### Reference

[The complete reference of pak functions](https://pak.r-lib.org/dev/reference/) is the most complete source of information about pak.

### I have a(nother) question

Don't hesitate to ask at the [RStudio Community forum](https://community.rstudio.com/).
Use the `pak` tag.

### I would like to report a bug

Head to the [pak issue tracker](https://github.com/r-lib/pak/issues).

## :sparkles: Features

:zap: Fast - parallel downloads and installation, caching, etc.

:safety_vest: Safe - dependency solver, system dependency solver, etc.

:convenience_store: Convenient - packages from multiple sources, time travel, etc.

See the [complete list of awesome features](https://pak.r-lib.org/dev/reference/features.html).

## [:arrow_down:](https://github.com/r-lib/rig#%EF%B8%8F--installation) Installation

### Pre-built binaries

Install a binary build of pak from our repository on GitHub:

``` r
install.packages("pak", repos = sprintf("https://r-lib.github.io/p/pak/stable/%s/%s/%s", .Platform$pkgType, R.Version()$os, R.Version()$arch))
```

This is supported for the following systems:

| OS                 | CPU     | R version         |
|--------------------|---------|-------------------|
| Linux              | x86_64  | R 3.4.0 - R-devel |
| Linux              | aarch64 | R 3.4.0 - R-devel |
| macOS High Sierra+ | x86_64  | R 3.4.0 - R-devel |
| macOS Big Sur+     | aarch64 | R 4.1.0 - R-devel |
| Windows            | x86_64  | R 3.4.0 - R-devel |

For macOS we only support the official CRAN R build.
Other builds, e.g.
Homebrew R, are not supported.

### Install from CRAN

Install the released version of the package from CRAN as usual:

``` r
install.packages("pak")
```

This potentially needs a C compiler on platforms CRAN does not have binaries packages for.

### Other platforms and nightly builds

See the [installation page](https://pak.r-lib.org/dev/reference/install.html)!

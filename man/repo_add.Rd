\title{Add a new CRAN-like repository}
\usage{
repo_add(..., .list = NULL)

repo_resolve(spec)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Repository specifications, possibly named character vectors.
See details below.}

\item{.list}{List or character vector of repository specifications.
This argument is easier to use programmatically than \code{...}. See
details below.}

\item{spec}{Repository specification, a possibly named character
scalar.}
}
\value{
\code{repo_resolve()} returns a named character scalar, the URL
of the repository.
}
\description{
Add a new repository to the list of repositories that pak uses to
look for packages.
}
\details{
\code{repo_add()} adds new repositories. It resolves the specified
repositories using \code{repo_resolve()} and then modifies the \code{repos}
global option.

\code{repo_add()} only has an effect in the current R session. If you
want to keep your configuration between R sessions, then set the
\code{repos} option to the desired value in your user or project \code{.Rprofile}
file.
}
\section{Repository specifications}{
The format of a repository specification is a named or unnamed
character scalar. If the name is missing, pak adds a name
automatically. The repository named \code{CRAN} is the main CRAN repository,
but otherwise names are informational.

Currently supported repository specifications:
\itemize{
\item URL pointing to the root of the CRAN-like repository. Example:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{https://cloud.r-project.org
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
\item \code{PPM@latest}, PPM (Posit Package Manager, formerly RStudio Package
Manager), the latest snapshot.
\item \verb{PPM@<date>}, PPM (Posit Package Manager, formerly RStudio Package
Manager) snapshot, at the specified date.
\item \verb{PPM@<package>-<version>} PPM snapshot, for the day after the
release of \verb{<version>} of \verb{<package>}.
\item \verb{PPM@R-<version>} PPM snapshot, for the day after R \verb{<version>}
was released.
}

Still works for dates starting from 2017-10-10, but now deprecated,
because MRAN is discontinued:
\itemize{
\item \verb{MRAN@<date>}, MRAN (Microsoft R Application Network) snapshot, at
the specified date.
\item \verb{MRAN@<package>-<version>} MRAN snapshot, for the
day after the release of \verb{<version>} of \verb{<package>}.
\item \verb{MRAN@R-<version>} MRAN snapshot, for the day
after R \verb{<version>} was released.
}

Notes:
\itemize{
\item See more about PPM at \url{https://packagemanager.posit.co/client/#/}.
\item The \verb{RSPM@} prefix is still supported and treated the same way as
\verb{PPM@}.
\item The MRAN service is now retired, see
\url{https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sql-blog/microsoft-r-application-network-retirement/ba-p/3707161}
for details.
\item \code{MRAN@...} repository specifications now resolve to PPM, but note that
PPM snapshots are only available from 2017-10-10. See more about this
at \url{https://posit.co/blog/migrating-from-mran-to-posit-package-manager/}.
\item All dates (or times) can be specified in the ISO 8601 format.
\item If PPM does not have a snapshot available for a date, the next
available date is used.
\item Dates that are before the first, or after the last PPM snapshot
will trigger an error.
\item Unknown R or package versions will trigger an error.

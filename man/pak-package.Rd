\title{pak: Another Approach to Package Installation}
\description{
The goal of 'pak' is to make package installation faster and more reliable. In particular, it performs all HTTP operations in parallel, so metadata resolution and package downloads are fast. Metadata and package files are cached on the local disk as well. 'pak' has a dependency solver, so it finds version conflicts before performing the installation. This version of 'pak' supports CRAN, 'Bioconductor' and 'GitHub' packages as well.

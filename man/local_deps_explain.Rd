\title{Explain dependencies of a package tree}
\usage{
local_deps_explain(deps, root = ".", upgrade = TRUE, dependencies = NA)

local_dev_deps_explain(deps, root = ".", upgrade = TRUE, dependencies = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{deps}{Package names of the dependencies to explain.}

\item{root}{Path to the package tree.}

\item{upgrade}{Whether to use the most recent available package
versions.}

\item{dependencies}{What kinds of dependencies to install. Most commonly
one of the following values:
- `NA`: only required (hard) dependencies,
- `TRUE`: required dependencies plus optional and development
  dependencies,
- `FALSE`: do not install any dependencies. (You might end up with a
  non-working package, and/or the installation might fail.)
See [Package dependency types] for other possible values and more
information about package dependencies.}

\description{
These functions are similar to [pkg_deps_explain()], but work on a
local package tree. `local_dev_deps_explain()` also includes development
dependencies.

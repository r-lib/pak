## Pre-built binaries

Our pre-built binaries have the advantage that they are completely
self-containted and dependency free.
No additional R packages, system libraries or tools (e.g. compilers) are
needed for them.
Install a pre-built binary build of pak from our repository on GitHub:

``` r
install.packages("pak", repos = sprintf(
  "https://r-lib.github.io/p/pak/stable/%s/%s/%s",
  .Platform$pkgType,
  R.Version()$os,
  R.Version()$arch
))
```

This is supported for the following systems:

| OS                    | CPU       | R version                         |
|-----------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| Linux                 | x86_64    | R 3.4.0 - R-devel                 |
| Linux                 | aarch64   | R 3.4.0 - R-devel                 |
| macOS High Sierra+    | x86_64    | R 3.4.0 - R-devel                 |
| macOS Big Sur+        | aarch64   | R 4.1.0 - R-devel                 |
| Windows               | x86_64    | R 3.4.0 - R-devel                 |
| FreeBSD 13.x or later | x86_64    | R 4.4.x                           |
| OpenBSD 7.4, 7.5, 7.6 | x86_64    | R 4.2.x (7.4, 7.5), R 4.4.x (7.6) |
| NetBSD 10.0           | x86_64    | R 4.4.x                           |
| DragonFly BSD 6.4     | x86_64    | R 4.3.x                           |

### Notes

* For macOS we only support the official CRAN R build. Other builds, e.g.
  Homebrew R, are not supported.
* We only support R builds that have an R shared library. CRAN's Windows
  and macOS installers are such, so the the R builds in the common Linux
  distributions. But this might be an issue if you build R yourself without
  the `--enable-R-shlib` option.

## Install from CRAN

Install the released version of the package from CRAN as usual:

``` r
install.packages("pak")
```

This potentially needs a C compiler on platforms CRAN does not have
binaries packages for.

## Nightly builds

We have nightly binary builds, for the same systems as the table above:

``` r
install.packages("pak", repos = sprintf(
  "https://r-lib.github.io/p/pak/devel/%s/%s/%s",
  .Platform$pkgType,
  R.Version()$os,
  R.Version()$arch
))
```

### `stable`, `rc` and `devel` streams

We have three types of binaries available:

* `stable` corresponds to the latest CRAN release of CRAN.
* `rc` is a release candidate build, and it is available about 1-2 weeks
  before a release. Otherwise it is the same as the `stable` build.
* `devel` has builds from the development tree. Before release it might be
  the same as the `rc` build.

The streams are available under different repository URLs:

``` r
stream <- "rc"
install.packages("pak", repos = sprintf(
  "https://r-lib.github.io/p/pak/%s/%s/%s/%s",
  stream,
  .Platform$pkgType,
  R.Version()$os,
  R.Version()$arch
))
```

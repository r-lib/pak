# Package installation

```{asciicast asciicast-setup, include = FALSE, cache = FALSE}
dir.create(.lib <- tempfile())
.libPaths(c(.lib, .libPaths()))
```

## How do I reinstall a package?

pak does not reinstall a package, if the same version is already installed.
Sometimes you still want a reinstall, e.g. to fix a broken installation.
In this case you can delete the package and then install it, or use the
`?reinstall` parameter:

```{asciicast faq-reinstall}
pak::pkg_install("tibble")
```

```{asciicast faq-reinstall-2}
pak::pkg_install("tibble?reinstall")
```

## How do I install a package from source?

To force the installation of a source package (instead of a binary
package), use the `?source` parameter:

```{asciicast faq-source}
pak::pkg_install("tibble?source")
```

## How do I ignore an optional dependency?

```{asciicast faq-ignore}
pak::pkg_install(
  c("tibble", "DiagrammeR=?ignore", "formattable=?ignore"),
  dependencies = TRUE
)
```

The syntax is
```
<packagename>=?ignore
```

Note that you can only ignore _optional_ dependencies, i.e. packages in
`Suggests` and `Enhances`.

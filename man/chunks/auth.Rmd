## Configuring authenticated repositories

To use authentication you need to include a user name in the repository
URL. You can set the repository URL in the `repos` option with
[base::options()] as usual, or you can use [repo_add()].

```{r, setup, include = FALSE}
# turn off bioc repos, for simplicity
library(pak)
options(pkg.use_bioconductor = FALSE)
options(width = 100)
options(pkg.show_progress = FALSE)
```

For testing purposes pak includes a web app that creates an authenticated
proxy to CRAN. This is how to run the proxy in a subprocess:

```{r, proxy-start, message = FALSE}
repo <- webfakes::new_app_process(pak:::auth_proxy_app())
repo$url()
```

(This needs the webfakes and callr packages.)

Next, we onfigure the proxy as the main CRAN repository. The default user
name of the proxy is `"username"` and the default password is `"token"`.
We want to replace the default CRAN repository with the proxy, so we name
it `CRAN`:

```{r repo-add}
repo_add(CRAN = repo$url(), username = "username")
repo_get()
```

Note that the output includes a `username` and a `has_password` column.
These are only present if at least one configured repository needs
authentication. `has_password` is `FALSE` here, because pak did not find
the credentials for this repository.

`repo_get()` also displays a message if it cannot find the credentials
for an authenticated repository.

Next we are going to store the credentials in a place where pak can find
them.

## Credential lookup

pak can look up credentials from two sources:
1. The current user's `netrc` file.
2. The system credential store via the keyring package. pak comes with its
   own copy of the keyring package, you don't need to install it
   separately.

We suggest that you use the system credential store whenever you can.

### `netrc` files

pak looks for the `netrc` file at `~/.netrc`. On Windows it also looks
for `~/_netrc` if the file starting with a dot does not exist.

If you create a `netrc` file, make sure that is only readable by you.
E.g. on Unix run
```sh
chmod 600 ~/.netrc
```

`netrc` files are simple text files that can store passwords for multiple
hosts. They may contain three types of tokens:

#### `machine <hostname>`

A host name, without the protocol. Subsequent `login` and `password`
tokens belong to this host, until another `machine` token is found, or
the end of file.

#### `login <username>`

User name. It must be preceded by a `machine` token.

#### `password <password>`

Password. It must be preceded by a `machine` and a `login` token.

Whitespace is ignored in `netrc` files. You may include multiple tokens
on the same line, or have one token per line. Here is an example:

```
machine myhost.mydomain.com login myuser password secret
machine myhost2.mydomain.com
login myuser
password secret
login anotheruser
password stillsecret
```

If you need to include whitespace in a password, put the password in double
quotes.

### The credential store

pak uses the keyring package to query the system credential store (or an
alternative keyring credential store) to find credentials for authenticated
repositories. pak comes with a copy of the keyring package, so you don't
need to install it separately.

To store a repository password in the system credential store use the
`repo_auth_key_set()` function. If you want to use a non-default keyring
backend, set the `keyring_backend` option. In this manual we will use
the backend that stores secrets in environment variables. This is an
ephemetal store that is destroyed when the R process terminates.

To continue our example from above:

```{r key-set}
options(keyring_backend = "env")
repo_auth_key_set(repo$url(), username = "username", password = "token")
```

Use `repo_auth_key_get()` to check that the key is properly set:

```{r key-get}
repo_auth_key_get(repo$url(), username = "username")
```

`repo_get()` now does not show a warning message, and also sets the
`has_password` column to `TRUE`, because pak could find the credentials
for our CRAN proxy:

```{r repo-get}
repo_get()
```

### Repo vs. host credentials

pak handles credentials for repositories and hosts. A repository
credential's key is a URL with a non-empty path:
```
https://repo.host.com/repos/repo1
```
A host credential's is an URL with an empty path:
```
https://repo.host.com
```

pak always looks for repository credentials first. If it does not find
any credentials for a repository then it drops the path and looks for
host credentials.

Because `netrc` files only store domain names and not URLs, they can only
contain host credentials.

## Testing

To test that authentication works, use the `repo_status()` function:

```{r repo-status}
repo_status()
```

The output of `repo_status()` has extra columns, compared to `repo_get()`,
and it also has a separate row for each platform. If everything works,
then the `has_password` column is `TRUE` for authenticated repositories,
and the `ok` column is `TRUE` if `repo_status()` was able to perform
an (authenticated) HTTP HEAD request to the metadata file of a platform in
a repository.

If you need even more information about repo authentication, e.g. because
`repo_status()` shows some failures, then use the `repo_auth()` function:

```{r repo-auth}
repo_auth()
```

The output of `repo_auth()` has the following extra columns:

* `auth_domains`: these are the URLs that pak tries to use as the `service`
  when looking for credentials in the keyring. For our proxy, it tries
  these URLs:
  ```{r repo-auth-domains}
  repo_auth()$auth_domains
  ```
* `auth_domain`: one of `auth_domains`, the URL for which pak found
  credentials in the keyring. If no credentials were found, then this is
  `NA`.
* `auth_source`: a short string that explains where pak found the
  credentials (or `NA` if not credentials were found). For examples
  `netrc` means the user's `netrc` file, and `keyring:macos` means the
  macOS system credential store.
* `auth_error`: `NA` for successful credential search, otherwise a short
  error message on why the search failed. Typically it would fail is the
  credentials are not in the credential store.

## Usage

Once you set up your authenticated repositories, and stored the required
passwords in the system credential store, you can use them like any
other repository. Operations that need authentication will always include
reassuring messages for successful authentications, and warning messages
for failed ones. Function calls that do not perform any HTTP reqquests,
e.g. because they list cached data, do not display such messages.

```{r meta-update}
meta_update()
```

```{r meta-list}
meta_list()
```

E.g. here `meta_update()` outputs an authentication message, but
`meta_list()` does not.

\title{Install a package tree}
\usage{
local_install(
  root = ".",
  lib = .libPaths()[1],
  upgrade = TRUE,
  ask = interactive(),
  dependencies = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{root}{Path to the package tree.}

\item{lib}{Package library to install the packages to. Note that _all_
dependent packages will be installed here, even if they are
already installed in another library. The only exceptions are base
and recommended packages installed in `.Library`. These are not
duplicated in `lib`, unless a newer version of a recommemded package
is needed.}

\item{upgrade}{When `FALSE`, the default, pak does the minimum amount
  of work to give you the latest version(s) of `pkg`. It will only upgrade
  dependent packages if `pkg`, or one of their dependencies explicitly
  require a higher version than what you currently have. It will also
  prefer a binary package over to source package, even it the binary
  package is older.

  When `upgrade = TRUE`, pak will ensure that you have the latest
  version(s) of `pkg` and all their dependencies.}

\item{ask}{Whether to ask for confirmation when installing a different
version of a package that is already installed. Installations that only
add new packages never require confirmation.}

\item{dependencies}{What kinds of dependencies to install. Most commonly
one of the following values:
- `NA`: only required (hard) dependencies,
- `TRUE`: required dependencies plus optional and development
  dependencies,
- `FALSE`: do not install any dependencies. (You might end up with a
  non-working package, and/or the installation might fail.)
See [Package dependency types] for other possible values and more
information about package dependencies.}
}
\value{
Data frame, with information about the installed package(s).
}
\description{
Installs a package tree (or source package file), together with its
dependencies.

\details{

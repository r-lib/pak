\usage{
lockfile_create(
  pkg = "deps::.",
  lockfile = "pkg.lock",
  lib = NULL,
  upgrade = FALSE,
  dependencies = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pkg}{Package names or package references. E.g.
  - `ggplot2`: package from CRAN, Bioconductor or a CRAN-like repository
    in general,
  - `tidyverse/ggplot2`: package from GitHub,
  - `tidyverse/ggplot2@v3.4.0`: package from GitHub tag or branch,
  - `https://examples.com/.../ggplot2_3.3.6.tar.gz`: package from URL,
  - `.`: package in the current working directory.

  See "[Package sources]" for more details.}

\item{lockfile}{Path to the lock file.}

\item{lib}{Package library to install the packages to. Note that _all_
dependent packages will be installed here, even if they are
already installed in another library. The only exceptions are base
and recommended packages installed in `.Library`. These are not
duplicated in `lib`, unless a newer version of a recommemded package
is needed.}

\item{upgrade}{When `FALSE`, the default, pak does the minimum amount
  of work to give you the latest version(s) of `pkg`. It will only upgrade
  dependent packages if `pkg`, or one of their dependencies explicitly
  require a higher version than what you currently have. It will also
  prefer a binary package over to source package, even it the binary
  package is older.

  When `upgrade = TRUE`, pak will ensure that you have the latest
  version(s) of `pkg` and all their dependencies.}

\item{dependencies}{What kinds of dependencies to install. Most commonly
one of the following values:
- `NA`: only required (hard) dependencies,
- `TRUE`: required dependencies plus optional and development
  dependencies,
- `FALSE`: do not install any dependencies. (You might end up with a
  non-working package, and/or the installation might fail.)
See [Package dependency types] for other possible values and more
information about package dependencies.}
}
\description{
The lock file can be used later, possibly in a new R session, to carry
out the installation of the dependencies, with
[lockfile_install()].
}
\details{
Note, since the URLs of CRAN and most CRAN-like repositories change
over time, in practice you cannot use the lock file _much_ later.
For example, binary packages of older package version
might be deleted from the repository, breaking the URLs in the
lock file.

Currently the intended use case of lock files in on CI systems, to
facilitate caching. The (hash of the) lock file provides a good key
for caching systems.
